title: "COMP 340: Analysis of Algorithms, Spring 2018"
catalog-desc: A study of the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Topics include asymptotic analysis, efficient algorithm design, sorting and order statistics, hashing, binary search trees, graph algorithms, matrix multiplication, and NP completeness. This course begins a more in-depth study in the theory and science of computation.

#### Topics

We will focus on chapter 5 and beyond from the text. This includes,
but is not limited to:

* Review of c++ fundamentals (chapters 1--4, comp161 notes)
* Review of algorithm design, analysis through sorting algorithms (chapter 10 \& notes)
* Standard container types (chapter 5)
* Classes and adt design (chapter 6)
* Recursive strategies (parts of chapters 7--9)
* Pointer and array logic (chapter 11)
* Dynamic memory management (chapter 12)
* Efficient implementation of container types such as vectors, lists,
  stacks, queues, trees, maps, sets, and graphs. (chapters 13--17)

### Assessment

#### Assignments

The course workload is as follows: 

| category | number of assignments |
| :-----:  |             :-------: |
| labs     |                    10 |
| homework |                 8--10 |
| projects |                     2 |
| exams    |                     7 |

Homework assignments will always either precede a lab to prepare for
it or follow a lab to complete it. Students are also encouraged to
look at the textbook's review questions, since the solutions are
available online. There will be no dedicated midterm or final exam,
but 7 exams spaced throughout the semester. Each exam will focus
primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, on the material covered
since the previous exam. The final exam will include a small number of
cumulative questions, and I reserve the right to include at most one
cumulative question on each of the other exams.

#### Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 13 hours per week. The follow tables provides
a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over different
course components for a 16 week semester.

| category                     |   total time |     time/week (hours) |
| :-----:                      |    :-------: |   :-----------------: |
| lectures+labs                |              |                     4 |
| homework                     |           48 |                     3 |
| exam study                   |           16 |                     1 |
| projects                     |           48 |                     3 |
| reading+unstructured study   |              |                     2 |
| ============================ | ============ | ===================== |
|                              |              |                    13 |

#### Grading

Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point
scale. Grades are marked with, in decreasing order, a check-plus,
check, or check-minus. Your final grade for these two assignment
categories is then based off the respective averages and determined by
the following chart. Notice this chart lists the minimum average
needed to achieve a particular letter grade.

| assignment avg. (min) | letter grade |
|               :-----: | :-------:    |
|                   2.8 | a            |
|                  2.75 | a-           |
|                   2.5 | b+           |
|                  2.25 | b            |
|                     2 | b-           |
|                  1.75 | c+           |
|                   1.5 | c            |
|                     1 | c-           |
|                  0.75 | d            |
|                   0.5 | f            |

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
*outside of class* to discuss your current standing.

| category      |    weight |
| :-----:       | :-------: |
| exams         |       45% |
| projects      |       25% |
| homework      |     12.5% |
| labs          |     12.5% |
| participation |        5% |
