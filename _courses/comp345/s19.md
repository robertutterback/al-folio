### Content

Introduces basic operating system concepts including virtualization,
memory management, process and thread management, concurrency, file
systems, and process scheduling. Students will also gain hands-on
experience with the C programming language and Unix-based operating
systems via programming projects.

#### Topics

Possible topics include:

| Processes             | Concurrent Data Structures |
| CPU Scheduling        | Concurrency Bugs           |
| Virtual Memory        | I/O Devices                |
| Free Space Management | Redundant Disk Arrays      |
| Locks                 | File Systems               |

<!-- #### Student Learning Outcomes -->

### Policies

* **Late assignments**: You have each been allotted a *total* of *5*
late days. You may apply these without any penalty to any project you
see fit, with the exception that you may use at most 2 on any
individual project. The whole point here is to give you some
flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the
like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions. Any projects turned
in late will result in a 20% penalty per day.

* **Academic dishonesty**: {{ site.data.policies.cheating_v1 }}

* **Collaboration**: {{ site.data.policies.collab_v2 }}

* **Electronic devices**: {{ site.data.policies.electronics_v1 }}

* **General expectations**: {{ site.data.policies.expectations_v1 }}

### Assessment

#### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and over the
semester, but on average should be about 12 hours per week. The follow
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                   | Amount | Final Grade Weight  | Total Time | Time/Week (Hours) |
|----------------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+-------------------|
| Lectures                   |     55 | 10% (Participation) | -          |               3.5 |
| Projects                   |   3--5 | 45%                 | 64         |               4.5 |
| Exam Study                 |      - | -                   | 27         |               1.5 |
| Exams                      |      3 | 45%                 | -          |                 - |
| Reading+Unstructured Study |      - | -                   |            |               2.5 |
|----------------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+-------------------|
|                            |        |                     |            |                12 |

#### Grading

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the Socrative (https://socrative.com)
app, so youâ€™ll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories, with weights shown above. You can estimate your
current grade based on your scores and these weights. You may always
visit the instructor *outside of class* to discuss your current
standing.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

### Schedule
The following **tentative** calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
are listed in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar
is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course*.

<!-- (let* ((start-date (org-read-date nil nil "2018-01-15")) -->
<!--        (end-date (org-read-date nil nil "2018-05-02")) -->
<!--        (days (list "Mon" "Tue" "Wed" "Fri")) -->
<!--        (current start-date)) -->
<!--   (while (string< current end-date) -->
<!--     (let* ((time (org-time-string-to-time current)) -->
<!--            (day (format-time-string "%a" time))) -->
<!--       (if (member day days) -->
<!--           (princ (concat (format-time-string "%a %m/%d" time) "\n")))) -->
<!--     (setq current (org-read-date nil nil "++1" nil (org-time-string-to-time current))))) -->
