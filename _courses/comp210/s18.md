title: "COMP 210: Object-Oriented Programming, Spring 2018"
catalog-desc: Object-Oriented Programming exposes students to basic and advanced topics in object-oriented program design and development using the Java programming language. Students will learn to develop graphical user interface (GUI) programs as well as explore some classic object-oriented design patterns. This course follows COMP 220 and completes the lab-based, introductory programming sequence.

### Content

Students will explore the ideas and concepts brought up in class and
homework assignments during the weekly lab session. In addition to
hands on exercises, lab sessions will be used to explore current,
relevant research in computer science.

#### Topics and Objectives

We will focus on chapter 5 and beyond from the text. This includes,
but is not limited to:

* Review of c++ fundamentals (chapters 1--4, comp161 notes)
* Review of algorithm design, analysis through sorting algorithms (chapter 10 \& notes)
* Standard container types (chapter 5)
* Classes and adt design (chapter 6)
* Recursive strategies (parts of chapters 7--9)
* Pointer and array logic (chapter 11)
* Dynamic memory management (chapter 12)
* Efficient implementation of container types such as vectors, lists,
  stacks, queues, trees, maps, sets, and graphs. (chapters 13--17)
  
#### Sources

There is no course textbook. I will assign readings from various
sources. Links to these sources or the material itself will be posted
on this webpage as needed.

#### Programming Environment

This course utilizes the Eclipse?

and the GNU compiler for C++
development.

All programs written in this course are required to compile and run on
a server running Ubuntu 16.04.3. All students will have access to the
departmental server and thereby the above development tools. While
development is not required in this environment, *failure to properly
port a program to the required environment could result in your
program not compiling correctly at the time of grading*. All software
for this course is available free of charge and can be found on the
web if students wish to install it on their personal machines.

### Policies

* **General expectations**: {{ site.data.policies.expectations_v1 }}
TLDR; I have high expectations, but provide a high level of support for you to reach them.

* **Late assignments**: {{ site.data.policies.late_none_v1 }}

* **Academic dishonesty**: {{ site.data.policies.cheating_v1 }}

* **Collaboration**: {{ site.data.policies.collab_v1 }}

* **Electronic devices**: {{ site.data.policies.electronics_v1 }}

### Assessment

#### Assignments

The course workload is as follows: 

| category | number of assignments |
| :-----:  |             :-------: |
| labs     |                    10 |
| homework |                 8--10 |
| projects |                     2 |
| exams    |                     7 |

Homework assignments will always either precede a lab to prepare for
it or follow a lab to complete it. Students are also encouraged to
look at the textbook's review questions, since the solutions are
available online. There will be no dedicated midterm or final exam,
but 7 exams spaced throughout the semester. Each exam will focus
primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, on the material covered
since the previous exam. The final exam will include a small number of
cumulative questions, and I reserve the right to include at most one
cumulative question on each of the other exams.

#### Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 13 hours per week. The follow tables provides
a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over different
course components for a 16 week semester.

| category                     |   total time |     time/week (hours) |
| :-----:                      |    :-------: |   :-----------------: |
| lectures+labs                |              |                     4 |
| homework                     |           48 |                     3 |
| exam study                   |           16 |                     1 |
| projects                     |           48 |                     3 |
| reading+unstructured study   |              |                     2 |
| ============================ | ============ | ===================== |
|                              |              |                    13 |

#### Grading

Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point
scale. Grades are marked with, in decreasing order, a check-plus,
check, or check-minus. Your final grade for these two assignment
categories is then based off the respective averages and determined by
the following chart. Notice this chart lists the minimum average
needed to achieve a particular letter grade.

| assignment avg. (min) | letter grade |
|               :-----: | :-------:    |
|                   2.8 | A            |
|                  2.75 | A-           |
|                   2.5 | B+           |
|                  2.25 | B            |
|                     2 | B-           |
|                  1.75 | C+           |
|                   1.5 | C            |
|                     1 | C-           |
|                  0.75 | D            |
|                   0.5 | F            |

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
*outside of class* to discuss your current standing.

| category      |    weight |
| :-----:       | :-------: |
| exams         |       45% |
| projects      |       25% |
| homework      |     12.5% |
| labs          |     12.5% |
| participation |        5% |
