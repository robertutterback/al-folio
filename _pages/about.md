I am an assistant professor in the department of Mathematics and
Computer Science at [Monmouth College](http://www.monmouthcollege.edu). I got my Ph.D. in Computer
Science from [Washington University in St. Louis](http://www.wustl.edu)
under [Kunal Agrawal](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kunal/) and [Angelina Lee](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/). My research involves
both theoretical and systems aspects of parallel computing. I also
hold a B.S. in mathematics and computer science
from [Truman State University](http://www.truman.edu).
