title: "COMP 340: Analysis of Algorithms, Spring 2018"
catalog-desc: A study of the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Topics include asymptotic analysis, efficient algorithm design, sorting and order statistics, hashing, binary search trees, graph algorithms, matrix multiplication, and NP completeness. This course begins a more in-depth study in the theory and science of computation.

### Content

The study of algorithms is one of the most crucial areas of in
Computer Science. In this course, students will learn the basic tools
of algorithm design and analysis through the study of some of the most
well known and important algorithms. By the end of the semester,
students will have developed not only a firm grounding in the analysis
and design of algorithms, but working knowledge of the algorithms that
have made computing what it is today.  

There are too many algorithms topics to cover fully in a one semester
course. To compensate, students will complete an in-depth research
project on an algorithms-related topic of their choice, providing not
only further depth but also project management skills. While this
class focuses mostly on the theoretical design and analysis of
algorithms, students will have opportunities to implement algorithms
in the language of their choice.

<!-- While it certainly is possible to study algorithms in the absence of -->
<!-- programming, concrete implementations provide a tangible means of -->
<!-- playing with the course material. As a part of the class, students -->
<!-- will implement, in the language of their choice, present and -->
<!-- demonstrate the algorithms from the text. Regular presentations of -->
<!-- code will provide a backdrop for discussions of the relationships -->
<!-- between programming, algorithms and the science of computing. -->

#### Topics

This course will emphasize the first eight chapters of the main text (TADM)
interleaved with selections from ADPS:

* Basic Design and Analysis [TADM 1-2] 
* Parallel Design and Analysis [ADPS 1,5]
* Standard Data Structures [TADM 3]
* Sorting and Searching [TADM 4]
* Parallel Operations on Sequences [ADPS 6]
* Parallel Design Techniques [ADPS 7-8]
* Graph Traversal [TADM 5]
* Weighed Graph Algorithms [TADM 6]
* Parallel Graph Algorithms [Parts of ADPS 14-18]
* Combinatorial Search & Heuristics [TADM 7] 
* Dynamic Programming [TADM 8, ADPS 19]

Time permitting, weâ€™ll examine TADM chapter 9 and some basic issues in
NP-Completeness and reductions.
  
#### Sources

The required course textbook is:

* Skiena, Steven S. *The Algorithm Design Manual*. Second
Editions. Springer. London. 2012.  ISBN-13: 978-1-84800-069-8

We will also pull some parallel algorithms material from the online
textbook draft *Algorithm Design: Parallel and Sequential* (ADPS), by
Umut Acar and Guy Blelloch, available at
[http://www.parallel-algorithms-book.com/](http://www.parallel-algorithms-book.com/). Any
other required readings will be posted on this webpage as needed.

I encourage you to take advantage of the wealth of algorithms study
resources that can be found online. This material can be difficult;
exposure to multiple sources is always useful and sometimes necessary
to fully grasp it. I will list here some resources that may be useful
(and fun!). Please suggest links to add as you find them.

* [Data Structure Visualizations](http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html) (and some algorithms)

### Assessment

#### Assignments

The course workload is as follows: 

| Category           | Number of Assignments | Final Grade Weight |
| :-----             |              -------: |                 -: |
| Problem Sets       |                   6-8 |                20% |
| Quizzes            |                   5-6 |                25% |
| Paper+Presentation |                     1 |                20% |
| Midterm            |                     1 |                10% |
| Final              |                     1 |                15% |
| Participation      |                     - |                10% |

Generally problem sets and quizzes will alternate weeks. There will be
a research projects on any algorithms-related topic, culminating in a
paper and presentation to the class. The final exam will focus
primarily, but not exclusively, on material covered since the
midterm.

#### Grading

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories, with weights shown above. You can estimate your
current grade based on your scores and these weights. You may always
visit the instructor *outside of class* to discuss your current
standing.

#### Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and over the
semester, but on average should be about 13 hours per week. The follow
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                     |   Total Time |     Time/Week (Hours) |
| :-----                      |    -------:  |   -----------------:  |

<!--        (days (list "Mon" "Tue" "Wed" "Fri")) -->
<!--        (current start-date)) -->
<!--   (while (string< current end-date) -->
<!--     (let* ((time (org-time-string-to-time current)) -->
<!--            (day (format-time-string "%a" time))) -->
<!--       (if (member day days) -->
<!--           (princ (concat (format-time-string "%a %m/%d" time) "\n")))) -->
<!--     (setq current (org-read-date nil nil "++1" nil (org-time-string-to-time current))))) -->
