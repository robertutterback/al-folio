This is my calendar of classes, meetings, office hours, and other
college events. If you need to meet with me (outside of office
hours), email me a few open slots on the calendar. 

Until further notice, all my classes, meetings, and office hours will
be held virtually using [this Zoom
room](https://monmouthcollege.zoom.us/j/8038366952). Please make sure
your Zoom name is your own; I will not allow in names I do not
recognize.

<!-- I'm normally on campus from about 8 AM to 5 PM. -->
