### Content

This course is an exploration of modern programming languages through
the study and implementation of interpreters for fundamental language
features. By implementing small languages with common PL features,
students expand their skill set with both practical and theoretical
knowledge. To understand programming languages is to understand
programming and computation as a whole. A programming language is how
we describe a computational process and study of the languages
themselves helps to shed light on the inner workings of a computation.

**For the fall 2019 semester, this course is being taught as a
course-by-arrangement. There will be no lectures; instead students
will learn mostly via the textbook and office hours. We will meet in
my office once or twice a week.**

#### Sources

The main textbook will be:

* Krishnamurthi, Shriram and Lerner, Benjamin S. and Politz, Joe
Gibbs. *Programming and Programming Languages*. 2018. Available
[here](http://papl.cs.brown.edu/2018/) in HTML format.

Be aware that the textbook is a constant work-in-progress. We may
occasionally supplement this with:

* Krishnamurthi, Shriram. *Programming Languages: Application and
Interpretation*. 2012. Available
[here](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/) in HTML format.

Other sources will be provided to you or will be available online.

#### Topics

This course will, for the most part, follow the text. Topics to be covered will include:

* Principles of Language Design and Implementation
* Arithmetic Expressions
* Conditionals
* Functions and Procedures
* Records
* State and Mutation
* Garbage Collection
* Types
* Objects
* Parametrized Types
* Type Inference

#### Programming Environment

We’ll be diving in with the [Pyret](https://www.pyret.org) language that accompanies PAPL. Pyret has an in-browser development environment and so may be used on any computer with a (modern) web-browser.

We might, from time to time, look at some Racket as its used in
PLAI. If you need or want to update your DrRacket installation, here’s
the link.

### Policies

* **Late assignments**: You have each been allotted a *total* of *5*
late days. You may apply these without any penalty to any project you
see fit, with the exception that you may use at most 2 on any
individual project. The whole point here is to give you some
flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the
like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions. Any projects turned
in late will result in a 20% penalty per day.

* **Academic Dishonesty**: {{ site.data.policies.cheating_v1 }}

* **Collaboration**: {{ site.data.policies.collab_v2 }}

* **Electronic Devices**: {{ site.data.policies.electronics_v1 }}

* **General Expectations**: {{ site.data.policies.expectations_v1 }}

### Assessment

#### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 11.5 hours per week. The follow tables
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                   | Amount | Final Grade Weight     | Total Time | Time/Week (Hours) |
|----------------------------+--------+------------------------+------------+-------------------|
| Meetings                   |      - | 10% (Participation)    |          - |               1.5 |
| Interpreters               |   5--7 | 30%                    |         56 |               3.5 |
| Homework                   |   2--3 | 5%                     |          8 |               0.5 |
| Paper+Presentation         |      1 | 20%                    |         24 |               1.5 |
| Exams                      |      2 | 15% Midterm, 20% Final |          - |                 - |
| Exam Study                 |      - | -                      |          8 |               0.5 |
| Reading+Unstructured Study |      - | -                      |         16 |                 4 |
|----------------------------+--------+------------------------+------------+-------------------|
|                            |        | 100%                   |            |              11.5 |

#### Grading

Your participation grade is based mainly on your preparation for the
class meetings. Your final grade is based on a weighted average of
particular assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade
based on your scores and these weights. You may always visit the
instructor *outside of class* to discuss your current standing.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

### Schedule
The following calendar should give you a feel for how work is
distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events are listed
in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar is subject
to change based on the circumstances of the course*.
