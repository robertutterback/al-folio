### Content

This course is an exploration of modern programming languages through
the study and implementation of interpreters for fundamental language
features. By implementing small languages with common PL features,
students expand their skill set with both practical and theoretical
knowledge. To understand programming languages is to understand
programming and computation as a whole. A programming language is how
we describe a computational process and study of the languages
themselves helps to shed light on the inner workings of a computation.

#### Sources

The main textbook will be: 

* Krishnamurthi, Shriram and Lerner, Benjamin S. and Politz, Joe
Gibbs. *Programming and Programming Languages*. 2016. Available
[here](http://papl.cs.brown.edu/2016/) in HTML format.

We will supplement this with:

* Krishnamurthi, Shriram. *Programming Languages: Application and
Interpretation*. 2012. Available
[here](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/) in HTML format.

#### Topics

This course will, for the most part, follow the text. Topics to be covered will include: 

* Principles of Language Design and Implementation
* Arithmetic Expressions
* Conditionals
* Functions and Procedures 
* Records
* State and Mutation
* Garbage Collection
* Types
* Objects
* Parametrized Types 
* Type Inference

#### Programming Environment

We’ll be diving in with the Pyret language that accompanies PAPL. Pyret has an in-browser development environment and so may be used on any computer with a (modern) web-browser.
* http://www.pyret.org/
* Style Guide: http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2013/Pyret_Style_Guide.html

We might, from time to time, look at some Racket as its used in PLAI. If you need or want to update your
DrRacket installation, here’s the link.

### Assessment

#### Assignments

The course workload is as follows:

| Category           | Number of Assignments |
| :-----:            |             :-------: |
| Interpreters       |                  5--7 |
| Homework           |                  2--3 |

| Exams              |                     2 |

#### Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 11 hours per week. The follow tables
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                     |   Total Time |     Time/week (hours) |
| :-----:                      |    :-------: |   :-----------------: |

#### Grading

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
*outside of class* to discuss your current standing.

| Category             |    Weight |
| :-----:              | :-------: |
| Homework             |        5% |
| Interpreters         |       30% |
| Paper + Presentation |       20% |
| Midterm Exam         |       15% |
| Final Exam           |       20% |
| Participation        |       10% |
