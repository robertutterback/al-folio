### Content

In this course, students will extend the Design Recipe ideas to
explore the paradigm of Object-Oriented programming (OOP) using the
Java programming language. As with all programming paradigms, OOP
constitutes not just a set of tools for writing programs but a way of
thinking and reasoning about the structure of programs and
computations in general. The Object-Oriented paradigm draws on all the
computing and programming concepts students studied in the
introductory sequence.

#### Topics and Objectives

In this course students will explore the Object-Oriented paradigm for
programming. Just as the shift from Functional programming in Racket
to Imperative programming in C++ required a change in perspective, so
to will the shift to OOP in Java. Students will explore the conceptual
foundations of OOP as well as modern OOP in Java.

* Designing Object-Oriented Class Hierarchies
  * Classes and Class Hierarchies 
  * Abstract Classes
  * Generics
* Basic UML-style Diagrams
* Developing GUI-Based Programs using Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
* Basic OO Design Patterns

#### Sources

There is no course textbook. The standard Oracle-provided Java
reference and tutorial material will be heavily utilized, including:

* Oracle. *Java 8  API* 2014. [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)
* Oracle. *The Java Tutorials*. 2016. [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
<!-- * Oracle. Java SE APIs and -->
<!--   Documentation. 2014. [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/api-jsp-136079.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/api-jsp-136079.html) -->
  
We may also pull material from other sources, such as "How to Design
Classes" by Felleisen et. al., available at
[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDC/htdc.pdf](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDC/htdc.pdf). Links
to any sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.

If you would like a textbook for learning Java, I recommend

* Sestoft, Peter. *Java Precisely*. The MIT Press. 2016. ISBN-13: 978-0262529075

though most students are fine without a textbook.

#### Programming Environment

All programs written in this course are required to compile and run on
a Linux computer with Java 8 and the Eclipse IDE. You need at least
Java 8; more recent versions are fine. Java 10 and Eclipse are
installed on the department server, which can be accessed via a VNC
desktop session. All software for this course is available free of
charge from Oracle and the Eclipse Foundation.

* *Oracle JAVA JDK/JRE*: Get the Java SE
JDK. [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
)
* *Linux OpenJDK*: This is an open-source version of the JDK. If
you're running Linux, this might be easier for your to install and
shouldn't cause you any
problems. [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* *Eclipse IDE*: [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

### Assessment

#### Assignments

The course workload is as follows: 

| Category | Number Of Assignments |
| :-----:  |             :-------: |
| Labs     |                 8--10 |
| Homework |                 8--10 |
| Projects |                     2 |
| Exams    |                  5--7 |

Homework assignments will always either precede a lab to prepare for
it or follow a lab to complete it. There will be no dedicated midterm
exam, but 7 exams spaced throughout the semester. Each exam will focus
primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, on the material covered
since the previous exam. The final exam will include a small number of
cumulative questions, and I reserve the right to include at most one
cumulative question on each of the other exams.

#### Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 13 hours per week. The follow tables provides
a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over different
course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                     |   Total Time |     Time/Week (Hours) |
| :-----:                      |    :-------: |   :-----------------: |
| Lectures+Labs                |              |                     4 |
| Homework                     |           48 |                     3 |
| Exam Study                   |           16 |                     1 |
| Projects                     |           48 |                     3 |
| Reading+Unstructured Study   |              |                     2 |
| ============================ | ============ | ===================== |
|                              |              |                    13 |

#### Grading

Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point
scale. Grades are marked with, in decreasing order, a check-plus,
check, or check-minus. Your final grade for these two assignment
categories is then based off the respective averages and determined by
the following chart. Notice this chart lists the minimum average
needed to achieve a particular letter grade.

| Assignment Avg. (Min) | Letter Grade |
|               :-----: | :-------:    |
|                   2.8 | A            |
|                  2.75 | A-           |
|                   2.5 | B+           |
|                  2.25 | B            |
|                     2 | B-           |
|                  1.75 | C+           |
|                   1.5 | C            |
|                     1 | C-           |
|                  0.75 | D            |
|                   0.5 | F            |

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
*outside of class* to discuss your current standing.

| Category      |    Weight |
| :-----:       | :-------: |
| Exams         |       40% |
| Projects      |       25% |
| Homework      |     12.5% |
| Labs          |     12.5% |
| Participation |       10% |
