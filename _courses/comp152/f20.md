title: "COMP 152: Object-Oriented Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2020"
catalog-desc: A continuation of COMP 151 that explores the essential data structures and algorithms of modern computing, including lists, stacks, queues, heaps, and trees. Students will design, analyze, and build programs that implement and utilize these data structures to solve computational problems, including a thorough survey of sorting and search algorithms. These theoretical constructs are complemented by exposure to good software development practices, including data abstraction via abstract data types and object-oriented software design. Strong emphasis is put on analyzing and evaluating how implementation choices made by the programmer impact overall program performance and maintainability.

## Content

### Description

Data structures continues the study of abstraction and programming
through a focused study of data structures, algorithms, and abstract
data types. The primary focus of this course is the design and
development of algorithms and programs using data abstraction and
information hiding via abstract data types *ADTs*. Data abstraction
is absolutely fundamental to good programming practice and the
management of large scale problems and data sets. This course is
designed to round out a student's understanding of basic computer
science concepts while strengthening the program design and
development skills through continued use of an object-oriented design
methodology.

It is imperative that programmers and program designers be able to
determine which of the many solutions available is the best for their
specific task. Throughout the course, students will focus on to making
solid quantitative and qualitative judgments about program efficiency
and overall program design choices. Gone are the days when "it
works" is a good enough assessment for the quality of a program.

Students will explore the ideas and concepts brought up in class and
homework assignments during the weekly lab session. In addition to
hands on exercises, lab sessions will be used to explore current,
relevant research in computer science.

### Sources

The course textbook will be:

* Goodrich, Michael T. and Tamassia, Robert and Goldwasser, Michael H. *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python*. Wiley. 2013. ISBN-13:
978-1-118-29027-9.

Other sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.

### Topics

The course aims to cover most of chapters 1-8 and parts of chapters
9-12. Other elements may be covered as time allows. The topics include, but
are not limited to:

| - Review of Python fundamentals                     | - Object-Oriented Design Basics and Patterns  |
| - Experimental and Asymptotic Algorithm Analysis    | - Recursion                                   |
| - Arrays and Sequence Data Types                    | - Stacks, Queues, Deques, and Priority Queues |
| - Abstract Data Types                               | - Linked Data Structures                      |
| - Binary Search Trees and Tree Traversal Algorithms | - Maps and Dictionaries                       |
| - Sorting, Searching, and Selection Algorithms      | - Graph Algorithms (as time allows)           |

### Programming Environment

This course uses Python 3 and [repl.it](https://repl.it), an online IDE
service. Students will receive, complete, and submit assignments all
via the website. Students can also complete assignments on their local
machines (I recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)
software package) or on the departmental server, but all assignment
submissions must be done through [repl.it](https://repl.it) unless otherwise
specified.

## Assessment

### Assignments and Workload
The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 14 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category                   | Amount |  Final Grade Weight | Total Time | Time/Week (Hours) |
|----------------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+-------------------|
| Lectures                   |     41 | 10% (Participation) | -          |              2.25 |
| Labs                       |  8--10 |                 15% | -          |              2.75 |
| Homework                   |  8--10 |                 15% | 48         |                 3 |

| Projects                   |      2 |                 30% | 48         |                 3 |
| Reading+Unstructured Study |      - |                   - |            |                 2 |
|----------------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+-------------------|

Homework assignments will always either precede a lab to prepare for
it or follow a lab to complete it. Each exam will focus primarily, but
not necessarily exclusively, on the material covered since the
previous exam.

### Grading
Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point scale,
marked with (in decreasing order) a check-plus, check, or check
minus. Your final grade for these two assignment categories is then
based on the respective averages.

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the [Socrative](https://socrative.com)
app, so youâ€™ll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

## Student Learning Outcomes

This course covers a variety of knowledge areas as categorized by the
ACM/IEEE-CS Task Force on Computing Curricula. Note that not all of
these areas are introduced in this course; some are touched upon
previously and others will be developed further in later courses. At
the end of the course, students should achieve the following learning
outcomes with the specific level of mastery:
