### Content

The study of algorithms is one of the most crucial areas of in
Computer Science. In this course, students will learn the basic tools
of algorithm design and analysis through the study of some of the most
well known and important algorithms. By the end of the semester,
students will have developed not only a firm grounding in the analysis
and design of algorithms, but working knowledge of the algorithms that
have made computing what it is today.  

There are too many algorithms topics to cover fully in a one semester
course. To compensate, students will complete an in-depth research
project on an algorithms-related topic of their choice, providing not
only further depth but also project management skills. While this
class focuses mostly on the theoretical design and analysis of
algorithms, students will have opportunities to implement algorithms
in the language of their choice.

#### Topics

This course will emphasize the first nine chapters of the main text (TADM)
plus occasional material from other sources:

* Basic Design and Analysis [TADM 1-2]
* Parallel Design and Analysis [other sources]
* Standard Data Structures [TADM 3]
* Sorting and Searching [TADM 4]
* Graph Traversal [TADM 5]
* Weighed Graph Algorithms [TADM 6]
* Parallel Graph Algorithms [other sources]
* Combinatorial Search & Heuristics [TADM 7] 
* Dynamic Programming [TADM 8]
* Intractable Problems [TADM 9]

Time permitting, we’ll explore more advanced topics, such as
probabilistic or approximation algorithms.
  
#### Sources

The required course textbook is:

* Skiena, Steven S. *The Algorithm Design Manual*. Second
Editions. Springer. London. 2012.  ISBN-13: 978-1-84800-069-8

We will occasionally pull material from other sources, especially for
parallel algorithms. Any required readings will be posted on this
webpage as needed.

I encourage you to take advantage of the wealth of algorithms study
resources that can be found online. This material can be difficult;
exposure to multiple sources is always useful and sometimes necessary
to fully grasp it. I will list here some resources that may be useful
(and fun!). Please suggest links to add as you find them.

### Assessment

#### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and over the
semester, but on average should be about 13 hours per week. The follow
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                     |       Amount | Final Grade Weight    | Average Time/Week (Hours) |
|------------------------------+--------------+-----------------------+---------------------------|

Generally problem sets and quizzes will alternate weeks. There will be
a research project on any algorithms-related topic, culminating in a
paper and presentation to the class. There are two exams -- a midterm
and a final -- both worth 10% each. The final exam will focus
primarily, but not exclusively, on material covered since the
midterm. In other words, it will contain a few questions on material
from the first half of the semester.

#### Grading

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the [Socrative](https://socrative.com)
app, so you’ll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories, with weights shown above. You can estimate your
current grade based on your scores and these weights. You may always
visit the instructor *outside of class* to discuss your current
standing. Assignments and final grades use a standard grading scale
shown below and will not be curved except in rare cases when deemed
necessary by the instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*
