### Content

#### Description

An introduction to the hot topics of machine learning, data science
and data mining. The course aims to supply students with a useful
toolbox of machine learning techniques that can be applied to
real-life data. Techniques may include logistic and linear regression,
SVMs, decision trees, neural networks, and clustering. The focus will
be on developing important skills in preparing data and selecting and
evaluating models, though we will delve into the mathematical
intuition behind each model.

#### Topics

Possible topics include:

* Python for data science and visualization
* Linear models for regression
* Linear models for classification
* Preprocessing, feature selection and engineering
* Support vector machines
* Trees, forests, and ensembles
* Gradient boosting
* Model Evaluation and Selection
* Dimensionality reduction
* Clustering
* Word embeddings
* Neural Networks

#### Learning Objectives

* An understanding of the types of machine learning and the intuition behind the techniques listed above
* An ability to analyze real-world data and prepare it for learning/mining via data cleaning
* An ability to add, remove, and modify data features and evaluate their effect on ML models
* An ability to compare and evaluate the performance of several ML models on a particular dataset
* An ability to communicate algorithmic findings and effectively present results through visualization

Modeling*. Springer. 2013. ISBN-13: 978-1-4614-6848-6.

I also recommend, but do not require:

### Assessment

#### Assignments

The course workload is as follows:

| Category      | Number of Assignments | Final Grade Weight |
| :-----        |              -------: |                 -: |
| Homework      |                  5--7 |                50% |
| Midterm       |                     1 |                20% |
| Final         |                     1 |                20% |
| Participation |                     - |                10% |

Most (probably all) homework assignments will involve
programming. Each exam focuses primarily, but not necessarily
exclusively, on material covered since the previous exam. In other
words, the final exam may include one or two questions from first-half
material.

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make sure of the
[Socrative](https://socrative.com/) app, so you'll need to install
this on your phones. Participating in Socrative questions and with
in-class group activities is required for a decent participation
grade; a full grade also includes asking questions either in class or
in office hours.

#### Grading

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories, with weights shown above. You can estimate your
current grade based on your scores and these weights. You may always
visit the instructor *outside of class* to discuss your current
standing.

#### Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and over the
semester, but on average should be about 12 hours per week. The follow
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                     |   Total Time |     Time/Week (Hours) |
| :-----                       |     -------: |    -----------------: |
| Lectures                     |           55 |                   3.5 |
| Homework                     |           72 |                   4.5 |
| Exam Study                   |           27 |                   1.5 |
| Reading+Unstructured Study   |              |                   2.5 |
| ============================ | ============ | ===================== |
|                              |              |                    12 |

### Schedule
The following **tentative** calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
are listed in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar
is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course*.

<!-- (let* ((start-date (org-read-date nil nil "2018-08-21")) -->
