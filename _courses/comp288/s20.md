title: "COMP 288: Competitive Programming, Spring 2020"
catalog-desc: Competitive Programming prepares students for programming contests, such as the CCSC (Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges) student programming contest or the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) contest. Students gain valuable programming practice and review important computer science concepts learned in other classes. Most class meetings will be spent working on programming problems, either individually or in teams of 3. Core topics include developing fast solution skeletons, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and backtracking.

### Content

#### Description

This course will prepare students for programming contests, such as
CCSC's (Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges) student
programming contest or the ACM (Associating for Computing Machinery)
ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) contest. By
preparing for these contests students also gain valuable programming
practice and review important computer science concepts learned in
other classes. Most class meetings will be spent working on
programming problems, either individually or in teams of 3.

these **during any contest**. Internet access is not allowed during
competitions, nor are electronic devices.


#### Topics

The exact topics covered will depend on the background of the students
and how quickly they move through the material. Potential topics
include:

| &bull; How Contests Work          | &bull; Arithmetic and Algebra |
| &bull; Contest Software           | &bull; Combinatorics          |
| &bull; Solution Skeletons and I/O | &bull; Backtracking           |
| &bull; Data Structures            | &bull; Graph Traversal        |
| &bull; Strings                    | &bull; Graph Algorithms       |
| &bull; Sorting                    | &bull; Dynamic Programming    |
| &bull; Grids                      | &bull; Computational Geometry |

### Assessment

The class will be graded on a credit/no credit basis. For credit, you
must complete all but one of the assigned problems (usually 1 per
week), complete any assigned readings (which will be distributed to
you), attend class regularly, and participate in class. All submitted
code for assigned problems must run without crashing or generating an
error (though it may not successfully solve the problem), and at least
one submission must fully solve the problem. There is no final exam.

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week,
and will especially vary due to the nature of participation
courses. On average, students should expect 4-5 hours per week on this
course, including class meeting time.

| Category          | Time/Week (Hours) |
|-------------------+-------------------|
| Class Meetings    |                 2 |
| Assigned Problems |                 2 |
|-------------------+-------------------|
| Total             |                 4 |
