### Computer Science

* Matt Might [provides](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) a pretty comprehensive guide to what CS students
should know. There's not really enough time for us to get to
everything in class --- you'll need to put in time outside of class if
you want to know all of this. It's worth it, though.
* A nice [collection](https://github.com/nushackers/notes-to-cs-freshmen-from-the-future/blob/master/README.md) of advice and info. Although it says freshman,
it will likely be useful to all CS students.
* [Vizualizations](https://visualgo.net) of many algorithms and data structures.
* A [massive list](https://github.com/sdmg15/Best-websites-a-programmer-should-visit) of links for programmers, ranging from tech news
  to interview preparation to improving your English.
* [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com) is another list of resources. It's aimed
  toward self-taught software engineers, but the materials could be
  very useful if you're struggling in a particular course.
* Get better at using the shell with with [CMD Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/).  
* Visualize the code you write using [Python
  Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/). Despite the name, you can program
  in Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and more!
* A collection of [resources](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming) for programmers.  

### General Learning

* Coursera's free [Learning How to
  Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course
  will improve your learning of all topics, not just computer science.
* In a similar vein, improving your problem-solving skills will help
  many facets of your life. This
  [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/) is a
  pretty good one. Also check out Polya's [How to Solve
  it](https://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-Science/dp/069116407X).
* I heard you like lists, so [here](https://github.com/jnv/lists) is a list of cool lists.
