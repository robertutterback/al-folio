### Computer Science

* Matt Might [provides](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) a pretty comprehensive guide to what CS students
should know. There's not really enough time for us to get to
everything in class --- you'll need to put in time outside of class if
you want to know all of this. It's worth it, though.
* A nice [collection](https://github.com/nushackers/notes-to-cs-freshmen-from-the-future/blob/master/README.md) of advice and info. Although it says freshman,
it will likely be useful to all CS students.
* [Vizualizations](https://visualgo.net) of many algorithms and data structures.

### General Learning

* Coursera's free [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course will improve your
  learning of all topics, not just computer science.
