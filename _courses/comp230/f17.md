### Content

This course aims to convince students that no magic is required to
make computers work by teaching the design and operation of digital
computers. By learning about the organization of computers, including
processor datapath, processor control, memory systems, and I/O,
students will develop an intuition about why hardware is the way it is
and how software interacts with hardware. Through detailed
implementation experience students will learn to make careful
tradeoffs between functional, performance and cost goals when
selecting and interconnecting hardware components.

#### Topics

Possible topics include:

* Technology Trends in CPU performance
* Instruction Sets
* Computer Arithmetic
* Datapath and Control
* Pipelining
* Memory Hierarchies
* Input and Output
* Multiprocessors
* Digital Logic

#### Sources

The course textbook will be:

* Patterson, David A. and Hennessy, John L. *Computer Organization and
Design MIPS Edition, Fifth Edition: The Hardware/Software
Interface*. Morgan Kaufmann. 2013. ISBN-13: 978-0124077263.

Other sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.

### Assessment

#### Assignments

The course workload is as follows:

| Category | Number of Assignments |
| :-----:  |             :-------: |
| Homework |                  7--8 |
| Exams    |                     3 |

Some homework assignments will be written assignments only; some will
include programming components. Exams will be open book and notes
unless otherwise specified. Each exam focuses primarily, but not
necessarily exclusively, on material covered since the previous
exam. The final exam will include a small number of cumulative
questions, and I reserve the right to include at most two cumulative
questions on each of the other exams.

#### Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 11 hours per week. The follow tables provides
a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over different
course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                     | Total Time   |     Time/week (hours) |
| :-----:                      | :-------:    |   :-----------------: |
| Lectures                     |              |                     3 |
| Homework                     | 80           |                     5 |
| Exam Study                   | 16           |                     1 |
| Reading+Unstructured Study   |              |                     2 |
| ============================ | ============ | ===================== |
|                              |              |                    11 |

#### Grading

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
*outside of class* to discuss your current standing.

| Category      |    Weight |
| :-----:       | :-------: |
| Homework      |       35% |
| Exam 1        |       15% |
| Exam 2        |       15% |
| Final Exam    |       25% |
| Participation |       10% |
