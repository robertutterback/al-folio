  collaboration: "In general, you are encouraged to make use of the resources available
to you. This means it is OK to seek help from a friend, tutor,
instructor, internet, etc. However, *copying of answers and
any act worthy of the label of ``cheating'' is never permissible*! It
is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that
the resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable
but be prepared to be asked to defend your collaborations to the
instructor. *You should always be able to reproduce an answer
on your own, and if you cannot you likely **do not really known
the material***.

* When assignments are meant to be done in groups, you will be
directed to turn in one set of solutions per group.  

* All other assignments should represent your own work and effort.


All of the Monmouth College rules on [academic dishonesty](https://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/academics/teaching-learning-center/academic-honesty.aspx) apply. If you
violate the rules be prepared to face the consequences of your
actions."
