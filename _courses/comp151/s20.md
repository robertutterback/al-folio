### Content

#### Description

Introduction to Programming teaches basic programming skills that are
applicable to a variety of disciplines and also acts as a bridge to
continued studies in Computer Science. Students will work with the
Python programming language in order to solve basic problems involving
digital media: images, sound. By the end of the course students will
be able to read and develop computer programs utilizing the following
programming concepts: basic data types and encoding, variables and
scope, array and list data structures, if statements and conditional
execution, loops and iteration, functions, and object types.

#### Sources

One textbook is required:

* Guadial, Mark J. and Ericson, Barbara. *Introduction to Computing
and Programming in Python: A Multimedia Approach*. Fourth
Edition. Pearson. Hoboken, NJ. 2016. ISBN-13: 978-0134025544

You will *NOT* need the "access card package" with MyLab
Programming. Other sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.

#### Software

Introduction to Programming makes heavy use of two pieces of
software. Both are freely available for use on personal devices but
can also be accessed from the college's computers either directly or
via the web. All programming will be done using Jython Environment for
Students (JES). Downloads for JES can be found
[here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mjguz/mediacomp/mediaComp-teach/index.html#Python). Windows
users should download the version that includes the JAR. MAC users
will most likely need the version with OS X workaround. The question
and answer software Socrative will be used on an almost daily basis.
Students will need to create a free student account at
https://socrative.com where it is also possible to participate in
socrative sessions via the web. Socrative also provides free iOS and
Android apps for students to use. You can find them on the respective
app stores or get direct links at https://socrative.com/apps/.

### Assessment

#### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12.5 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category   | Amount |  Final Grade Weight | Time/Week (Hours) |
|------------+--------+---------------------+-------------------|
| Lectures   |    ~41 | 10% (Participation) |               2.5 |
| Labs       |  8--10 |                 10% |                 3 |
| Homework   |      8 |                 10% |                 1 |
| Exam Study |      - |                   - |                 1 |
| Exams      |      6 |                 45% |                 - |
| Projects   |      2 |                 25% |                 3 |
| Reading    |      - |                   - |                 2 |
|------------+--------+---------------------+-------------------|
| *Total*    |        |                     |              12.5 |

*Exams*: All exams are weighted equally and will take approximately
the same amount of time. Exams will generally focus on material
covered since the previous exam but will be in some sense cumulative
due to the nature of programming. Unless stated otherwise, assume that
exams will be pencil and paper and that computers will not be
available during the exam period.

*Projects*: Two larger scale programming projects will be undertaken
during the semester. These projects will be individual efforts and
will require much more effort than the programs written in lab or as
part of homework. Students can expect to have two weeks from the time
of the project assignment to complete the project.  One or more lab
periods will be dedicated to work on the project. It is highly
recommend that all students make ample use of the time given on these
projects.

*Homework*: Students will be assigned a set of problems from each
chapter of the book covered in the course. These problems are meant to
guide reading, prepare the student for in class problems, and survey
the material covered by the exam. Each student will turn in their own
set of solutions.

*Labs*: Students will be placed into groups of two or three for each
lab. Work will be done using paired programming, a programming
practice where each member of the group takes turns typing while the
other group member helps look for typos, bugs, and otherwise assists
in the design of the code. Each group will submit their work at the
end of the lab period regardless of the overall completeness of the
assignment. The goal is to make good constructive progress on the
assignment. Full credit can and will be given on unfinished work so
long as it can be executed to complete some portion of the given task,
shows evidence of purposeful progress, and the group made full use of
the lab period.

#### Grading

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point scale,
marked with (in decreasing order) a check-plus, check, or check
minus. Your final grade for these two assignment categories is then
based on the respective averages.

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities, but
especially daily use of Socrative for in-class question and answer
sessions. Questions will cover portions of the text that were assigned
as reading and will range from simple checks to see if the reading was
done to more challenging questions that follow from a close
examination of the reading.  For the most part, the only requirement
is to provide an answer to every question and participate in the
resultant discussions. On occasion, questions will be evaluated for
their correctness and performance on 3 these questions will also
factor into the course participation grade. Students who do the
reading and start the homework as soon as possible will have very
little to worry about.

While there is no strict attendance policy, the course participation
grade is based in large part on engagement with socrative. Absent
students cannot participate in socrative sessions. Students should
avoid unexcused absences, as defined in the college-wide absence
policy. Whenever possible, let the instructor know of the absence
before it occurs. When unexcused absences do occur, it is the
student's responsibility to make up for the lost class time and to
seek the permission of the instructor to hand-in or complete
assignments that are late due to an unexcused absence.

This course is designed around the assumption that students engage in
new ideas *before* they're covered in class meetings. This means doing
assigned reading, taking a stab at homework problems, and as a result
coming to class and lab with some understand about a new idea or, just
as likely, with a host of questions about something encountered in the
reading and homework. Not attending class, skipping lab, and putting
off work to the point that an extension is needed are signs that a
student isn't holding up their end of the bargain and is not prepared
to participate in class.
