    "The overall goal is to predict the fuel efficiency of car models based on historical data collected by the department of energy that can be found at https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml. In particular, the main goal is to predict the 2018 data from the 2015-2017 data. The main performance metric is R^2 and homework grades will partially depend on your test-set score.\n",
