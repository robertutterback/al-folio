#### Topics

TBD

#### Sources

The required course textbook is:

Kuhn, Max and Johnson, Kjell. *Applied Predictive
Modeling*. Springer. 2013. ISBN-13: 978-1-4614-6848-6.

I also recommend, but do not require:

Guido, Sarah and Muller, Andreas. *Introduction to Machine Learning
with Python*. O'Reilly. 2016. ISBN-13: 978-1449369415.

### Assessment

#### Assignments

The course workload is as follows: 

| Category           | Number of Assignments | Final Grade Weight |
| :-----             |              -------: |                 -: |
| Problem Sets       |                   6-8 |                20% |
| Quizzes            |                   5-6 |                25% |
| Paper+Presentation |                     1 |                20% |
| Midterm            |                     1 |                10% |
| Final              |                     1 |                15% |
| Participation      |                     - |                10% |

Generally problem sets and quizzes will alternate weeks. There will be
a research projects on any algorithms-related topic, culminating in a
paper and presentation to the class. The final exam will focus
primarily, but not exclusively, on material covered since the
midterm.

#### Grading

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories, with weights shown above. You can estimate your
current grade based on your scores and these weights. You may always
visit the instructor *outside of class* to discuss your current
standing.

#### Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and over the
semester, but on average should be about 13 hours per week. The follow
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                     |   Total Time |     Time/Week (Hours) |
| :-----                      |    -------:  |   -----------------:  |
| Lectures                     |              |                   3.3 |
| Problem Sets                 |           72 |                   4.5 |
| Exam/Quiz Study              |           27 |                   1.7 |
| Research Project             |           24 |                   1.5 |
| Reading+Unstructured Study   |              |                     2 |
| ============================ | ============ | ===================== |
|                              |              |                    13 |

### Schedule
The following **tentative** calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
are listed in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar
is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course*.

<!-- (let* ((start-date (org-read-date nil nil "2018-08-21")) -->
<!--        (end-date (org-read-date nil nil "2018-12-05")) -->
<!--        (days (list "Mon" "Tue" "Wed" "Fri")) -->
<!--        (current start-date)) -->
<!--   (while (string< current end-date) -->
<!--     (let* ((time (org-time-string-to-time current)) -->
<!--            (day (format-time-string "%a" time))) -->
<!--       (if (member day days) -->
